# InSpectro-Gadget

InSpectro-Gadget is a tool to obtain reference gene expression values from brain regions of interest for a set of neurotransmitter receptors and receptor subunits. Values are estimates for each voxel within the specified region and then presented graphically in a PDF report. Values are also returned as a Python dictionary for additional analysis.

The receptors and receptor subunits included are:

Gene expression data is obtained from the Allen Human Brain Atlas (https://human.brain-map.org/).

## Installation

The package can be installed via pip as follows:

```
pip install https://github.com/lizmcmanus/Inspectro-Gadget/archive/refs/heads/main.zip
```


## Usage
For each analysis, enter the path to your region or regions of interest. Label(s) for the regions and a specific output directory can also be specified but are not required.

Regions of interest should be binary images in 2 mm isotropic MNI152NLIN6Asym space. 


### Single region
To obtain receptor estimates for a single region enter that region's mask. A PDF report will be produced in the current working directory or in the output directory specified.

```
from inspectro_gadget.gadget import gadget

gadget_out =  gadget(['/home/data/region1_mask.nii.gz'],
              mask_labels=['Region 1'],
              out_root='/home/data/results')
```

The report will include a variety of information:

- An image showing the region being analysed, along with the estimated excitation/inhibition ratio for it

![Brain slices showing the region being analysed. The excitation/inhibition ratio for the region is also shown.](images/single-eiratio.png?raw=true "Single region mask image and excitation/inhibition ratio")

- Radarplots showing the receptor fingerprint of the region of interest. Separate ones are plotted for GABA+glutamate genes and for neuromodulators

![Radarplots showing receptor fingerprints for the region of interest.](images/single-radar.png?raw=true "Region of interest receptor fingerprints")

- Violinplots showing the range of gene expression within the region's mask for each of the included genes. GABAA alpha subunits and alpha2 noradrenaline receptor genes are shown here for illustration

![Example violinplots showing expression levels for the region of interest. GABAA alpha subunits and alpha2 noradrenaline receptor genes are shown for illustration.](images/single-violin.png?raw=true "Expression estimates for GABAA alpha subunits and alpha2 NA receptors")


### Two region comparison
To compare receptor estimates between two regions, enter masks for each. A PDF report will be produced in the current working directory or in the output directory specified.

```
gadget_out = gadget([['/home/data/region1_mask.nii.gz'],
                    ['/home/data/region2_mask.nii.gz']],
                    mask_labels=['Region 1', 'Region 2'],
                    out_root='/home/data/results')
```

The report will include a variety of information:

- An image showing the two regions being analysed, along with the estimated excitation/inhibition ratio for each

![Brain slices showing the two regions being analysed. The excitation/inhibition ratios for each region are also shown.](images/two-eiratio.png?raw=true "Two region mask images and excitation/inhibition ratios")

- Radarplots showing the receptor fingerprints for each of the regions. Separate ones are plotted for GABA+glutamate genes and for neuromodulators

![Radarplots showing receptor fingerprints for the two regions.](images/two-radars.png?raw=true "Two region receptor fingerprints")

- Violinplots showing the range of gene expression within each region's mask for each of the included genes. A comparison of the mean and shape of the distributions are also provided. GABAA alpha subunits and alpha2 noradrenaline receptor genes are shown here for illustration

### Multiple participant comparison
To analyse the similarity of receptor estimates across a group of participants, enter masks for each one. A participant overlap nifti image will be created in the current working directory or in the output directory specified, along with a PDF report. 

```
gadget_out = gadget(['/home/data/sub-01_region1_mask.nii.gz',
                     '/home/data/sub-02_region1_mask.nii.gz',
                     '/home/data/sub-03_region1_mask.nii.gz',
                     '/home/data/sub-04_region1_mask.nii.gz'],
                    mask_labels=['sub-01', 'sub-02', 'sub-03', 'sub-04'],
                    out_root='/home/data/results')
```

The report will include a variety of information:

- An image showing the overlap between participant masks

![Brain slices showing overlap between the participant masks.](images/multi-overlap.png?raw=true "Multiple participant mask overlap image")

- Estimates excitation/inhibition ratios for each participant's mask (and a group average value)

- ![Excitation/inhibition ratio estimates for each participant.](images/multi-eiratio.png?raw=true "Multiple participant excitation/inhibition ratios")

- Radarplots showing the receptor fingerprints for each participant's mask. Separate ones are plotted for GABA+glutamate genes and for neuromodulators

![Radarplots showing receptor fingerprints for participants.](images/multi-radars.png?raw=true "Multiple participant receptor fingerprints")

- Violinplots showing the range of gene expression within each participant's mask for each of the included genes. How far each participant mask's distribution median is from the group average is also provided. A set of AMPA receptor genes are shown here for illustration

![Example violinplots showing expression levels for each of the included genes. A set of AMPA receptor genes are shown for illustration.](images/multi-violins.png?raw=true "Individual expression estimates for a set of AMPA receptor genes")


### Important limitations
The Allen Human Brain Atlas data comes from six people, five of whom were male. Their ages ranged from 24 to 57 years. As brain morphology and gene expression can differ between the sexes and across the lifespan, the dataset may not be fully representative of the human population. As such, the results produced by this tool should be interpreted with these limitations in mind.
